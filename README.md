# ServiDrinkDataBaseFinalProj

Functionality:
Our group chose to implement an app that stores and allows users to search through information related drinks served by local restaurants. Users will be able to search for registered restaurants to see the drinks they serve, as well as search for specific drinks to see if they are served at any registered restaurant.
In addition to searching for restaurants and products, users will be able to rate products, which will be visible to other users when they view the respective product’s page. Users will also be able to save restaurants and products, which will allow them to quickly access the saved item’s information, as well as receive any updates related to the item. Users will also be able to block restaurants, which will prevent it from appearing in any searches.
